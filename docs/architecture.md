# üèó Architecture & Design

HireBot AI App Lite follows modern web development practices and architectural patterns:

## Design Patterns

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components for reusability and maintainability
- **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separation of data fetching and presentation logic
- **Context API Pattern**: Global state management using React Context
- **Custom Hooks Pattern**: Encapsulated reusable logic with custom React hooks
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access through service layers

## State Management

- **React Context API**: For global application state (auth, loading, etc.)
- **React Query**: For server state management with caching, background updates, and optimistic UI
- **Form State**: Managed with React Hook Form for efficient form handling

## API Integration

- **Service Layer**: Abstracted API calls through service modules
- **Axios Interceptors**: Centralized request/response handling
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management across API calls
- **Data Transformation**: Standardized data formatting between client and server
